Langraph is a library for building stateful,multi actor applciations with LLMs,use to create an agent and multi agent workflows.Compare to other LLM frameworks ,it offers these 
core benefits ,cycles,contllability and persistence .Langraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles,essentials for most agentic architectures,differentiating rom DAG based solutions

DAG : Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based solutions are gaining traction in various fields due to their unique structure and advantages. 


Why Langraph : Simplifies development,whenever we develop multi agent ai, we have 
State management ,agent co-ordination ,
Let's assume 
            Agent 1 -> Google search
 Chat ->   Agent 2 -> Wikipedia search  --> Static management &Agent Co-ordination (Agent 1 response may be depends on Agent 2)--> 
 Bot       Agent 3 -> Vector search


 Flexibility : Langraph provides tools eactly what to do.
 Scalability --> Large scale multi agent applciations (It can handle high volume of interaction) the interactions can be between agents and complex workflows


Fault Tolerance :
 Handle errors, fault tolerance ,reliability
